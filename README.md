Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The Driver Pass project is a driver learning application, the system is a web application that allows users to select driver learning packages.

What did you do particularly well?
I think that during the course one thing I did well was collecting system requirements and presenting them in the documents. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the business requirements as I feel like I have a better understanding of what the system requirements are now at the end of the project.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
For this project we utilized an interview transcript and UML diagrams to gather and piece together the user requirements. It is very important to consider user's needs as their experience with the application is key to creating a successful application.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
In the future, I think it is important to utilize the user’s need collection strategies we learned during the class. Being able to review a document, like an interview transcript, and collect system requirements and user needs and implement them into a system design is a critical skill for system design.
